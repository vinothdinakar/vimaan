For API which needs authentication
1) call /authenticate - the response will have a token
2) For other api which needs authentication, include file
    var tokenAuthentication = require(path.resolve('./libs/tokenAuthentication'));
3) Client needs to include token with every other request as a part of body or header - 'x-access-token'
