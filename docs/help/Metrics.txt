Metrics logs can be configured to push to Mongo or Splunk through configuration file

Whenever we need to add Metrics
1) include metricsLogger file
    var metricsLogger = require(path.resolve('./libs/metricsLogger'));
2) call the metrics api function
    metricsLogger.addMetrics(fid, {
        date: "",
        unitAddress: ""
    });
    we can add whatever property we need for future analysing
